Notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

The `gltf` crate adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- Fix `attemt to to subtract with overflow`-panic in `size_hint()` of sparse accessor when collecting items.
