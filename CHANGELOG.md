# Changelog

Notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

The `gltf` crate adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

## [0.12.0] - 2019-04-21

  - lazy_static
  - proc_macro2
  - quote
  - syn

### Fixed

- Borrow checker complaint regarding `Glb::from_reader`.

## [0.11.3] - 2019-02-21

### Added

- New function `gltf_json::Index::new` for export.
- Support for the `KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness` extension.
- Extra `Eq` and `PartialEq` implementations.

### Fixed

- `Accessor::min` is no longer serialized if `None`.
- `Extras::_allow_unknown_fields` is no longer serialized.
- `bufferView.byteOffset` is now optional.
- Node translation/rotation/scale values are now optional.
- Removed serialization of some default values.
- `extras::Void` is no longer serialized.

## [0.11.2] - 2018-07-08

### Fixed

- JSON chunk padding is now padded with spaces (0x20) rather than zeros.
- `None` is no longer serialized.
- `Vec` is no longer serialized when empty.

## [0.11.1] - 2018-06-10

### Added

- `payload` field in `Gltf` in order to handle binary glTF directly.
- `Error::Io` enum variant.
- `Gltf::from_reader_without_validation` and `Gltf::from_slice_without_validation`.
- All functionality from the `gltf-utils` crate, feature gated with the new
  `utils` feature.
- Most functionality from the `gltf-importer` crate, feature gated with the
  new `import` feature.
- `enum Uri` to represent uniform resource locators.

### Changed

- `fn Gltf::from_*` now imports binary glTF as well as standard glTF.
- `fn Gltf::from_reader` now requires `reader` to implement `std::io::Seek`.
- `Buffer::uri` now returns `None` in the case of binary glTF payload instead
	of the magic string `"#bin"`.
- The `POSITION` attribute is now required by all mesh primitives.
- Several renames:
	- `glb` → `binary`.
	- `Error::Glb` → `Error::Binary`.
	- `TrsProperty` → `Property`.
	- `InterpolationAlgorithm` → `Interpolation`.
	- `Target::path` → `Target::property`.
	- `Primitive::position_bounds` → `Primitive::bounding_box`.
- The `names` feature is now enabled by default, along with `utils` and
  `import`. Rationale: Pareto principle.

### Fixed

- Data structures in `gltf_json` now implement `Serialize`.

### Removed

- `fn Gltf::from_str` -- use `fn Gltf::from_slice` instead.
- `fn Gltf::from_value` -- no longer supported.
- `fn gltf::is_binary` -- use `slice.starts_with("glTF")` instead.
- `struct Unvalidated` -- replaced with `enum Validation`.
- `crate gltf-importer` -- no longer supported.
- `Node::matrix` -- use `transform().matrix()` instead.
- `Node::rotation` -- use `transform().decomposed()` instead.
- All hidden `as_json` functions -- no longer supported.
