# Contributing guide

Thank for you taking the time to contribute to `gltf`. Your contributions are valued, no matter how small.

## Branch conventions and pull requests

 * New features may be submitted to the `incoming` branch.
 * Bug fixes and minor changes to documentation may be submitted to the `patches` branch.
 * Any other branch other than `master`, `incoming`, and `patches` contains experimental code that may be referenced in issues.
 * The code in the `master` branch is intended to mirror the latest build on crates.io, so please avoid making pull requests into `master`.

 * Submit pull requests that implement new features, fix bugs, or improve ergonomics.

 * Improve formatting of code.
